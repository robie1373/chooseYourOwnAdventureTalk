# chooseYourOwnAdventureTalk

Caveat - This is super alpha. Just a proof of concept, really. At this point it isn't even feature complete. I wanted to get some feedback and show it off to some friends, though so you get to see it too. How special are you?

## Why have you done this sir?

This came out of a conversation at NoVaHackers. I was inspired to put together a simple web-based choose your own adventure framework for presentations. The goal is to get the audience involved and let them choose the path of the talk. They vote by throwing signs in the air. Couldn't be simpler.

## How's it work?

I don't fscking know! It's magic or sumpn. Actually it's all javascript and I'll be putting some HTML5 type junk in here eventually for more customization of content. 

Style is all CSS. Pretty much everything is classed and Ideded so you can write a style sheet or 5 and change the look of your adventure in the blink of an eye.

The end product will be all client-side. You'll be able to create your adventure, save the result to your local machine, and load it back into the app to show it at your local apiarist's meetup. Since it's free and open, you can even install it on your own server and share your brilliance with the world! (If you do, why not drop me a line?)

## Roadmap
 
   1. Adventure creation page
   2. Save adventure
   3. Upload adventure
   4. run uploads through https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_JSON_Sanitizer
   5. More slide formats
   6. Slide effects like bullets appearing and star wipes! (Yeah, you heard me.)
   7. Modularize navigation function to a plugin type thingy. This way the simple hand gesture interface could be swapped for an audience web interface that would allow them to vote on direction.
